		<h1>ðŸ”° Scoots' Stuff </h1>
			<p>Hello! I'm ScootsChan, otherwise known as Scoots, Daniel, or ScootalooTheSpy (though I no longer use that last name.)</p>
			
			<p>I'm usually just playing random games, from KanColle to Hearts of Iron 4.</p>
			
			<p>But here you can see some random things I tend to code!</p>

		<h2>Reichs and Republics</h2>
			<h3>A BallengerEarth Mod for Hearts of Iron 4</h3>
				<p><a href=https://trello.com/b/X2zeta9N/ballengerearth-hoi4-mod-roadmap>Roadmap</a></p>
				
				<p>Reichs and Republics is an upcoming mod for Hearts of Iron 4! It takes place within Fredreic-005a of BallengerEarth, a version of the world which Jaden of Russia didn't surrender to the Swedes. The Weltkrieg burned the world, but with the revolutions going on, a second one is bound to happen.</p>

		<h2>rKanColleLounge Visual Novel</h2>
			<h3>Missing shipgirls, insane admirals, and a stupid plethora of inside jokes</h3>
				<p><a href=https://github.com/ScootsChan/rKanColleLounge>GitHub Link</a></p>
				
				<p>rKanColleLounge is a visual novel based off of <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/>/r/KanColle</a>'s Admiral's Lounge and the shenanigans that occur within it. It follows the stories of missing shipgirls, who've returned as completely normal humans rather than kanmusume, as they try to convince the Joint Anti-Abyssal Staff that they're actually them. Stupid idea, I know. Both me and Astraph at the time were half-awake thinking of the idea and putting it into motion.</p>
